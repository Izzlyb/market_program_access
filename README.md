# market_program_access
Access the stock market via Python using different mechanisms

this repo will hold different programs or code snippets to access the stocks market
for analysis, monitor and trade.

Different programs might use different ways to access the market, different API or 
different access providers.

Most of the programs will be created from YouTube tutorials, so I will mention the 
YouTube link and the author of the video for reference.
